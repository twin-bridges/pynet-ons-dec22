Functions Ex4
--------------

Based on your earlier exercise where you parsed the serial number from
show_version
  
a. Create two functions
b. Function1 opens the file and returns all of the data in the file as a text 
   string. This function should take one argument (the filename).
   
   If the given file is not found gracefully handle the error and print a message
   to the screen (return an empty string from the function).

c. Function2 parses the show_version output and returns the serial number
