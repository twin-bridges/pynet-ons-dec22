Lists Ex4
=========

1. Use list(range(1,50)) to create a new list named my_list.

2. Add "hello" and "world" onto the end of the list (as two new elements).

3. Change index-0 to be "whatever". Use rich.print() to print out your current
   list.

4. Create a new list using a list slice where the new list is the last three 
   elements of my_list. Use rich.print() to print out this new list.

5. Make a second new list using a list slice where this list is the first
   seven elements of my_list. Print out this new list.
