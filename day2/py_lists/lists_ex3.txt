Lists Ex3
=========

1. In your Python program, create the following string.

sentence = "This is a sentence consisting of eight words."

2. Use the split() method to create a new variable containing a list of 
   the words in the sentence.

3. Change the first element of your newly created list to be all lower
   case.

4. Change the last element of your newly created list to be just "words"
   i.e. no period at the end.

5. Check whether the word "eight" exists in the list.
