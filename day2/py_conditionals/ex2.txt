Conditionals Ex2
================

1. Create a variable named os_version with the following value:

os_version = "15.4(2)T1"

2. Using the .split() method, extract the major version 15 and
the minor version 4. Note, you potentially will have to use split()
twice to extract the minor version.

3. Check if the major version is version 16 or greater. Print a message if
this is True.

4. If that fails (i.e. major version is less than 16), then check if
the major version is 15, and the minor version is 2 or greater (i.e. 15.2
or greater). Print a message if this is True.

5. If neither of these conditions are true, print a message indicating that the
os_version is invalid.

/* Note, you will likely need to cast the string as integers using int(my_var) */

--------
In [1]: my_var = "15"

In [2]: int(my_var)
Out[2]: 15
