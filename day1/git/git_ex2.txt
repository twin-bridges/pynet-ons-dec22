Back on your "pynet-test" repository, create a branch named "dev2". Checkout this branch.

Using VS Code add a new folder named "day1" containing three files: net1.py, net2.py, and net3.py. 
What each file contains does not matter.

Commit those three files into the "dev2" branch. Using "git log" verify that the "dev2" branch 
is now at least one commit further than the "main" branch.

Merge the "dev2" changes into the "main" branch. Remember you should first checkout the "main" 
branch and then "merge from" dev2.

Using "git log" verify that the "main" branch and the "dev2" branch are now both on the 
same commit.

Using VS Code, verify that your "main" branch now has the three files that you created in
the "dev2" branch.
