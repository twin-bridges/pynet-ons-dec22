Lists Ex2
----------

a. Create two lists named list1 and list2 containing various strings, integers,
   and floats.

b. Create a list3 by concatenating list1 and list2 together.

c. Use rich.print to print out this list3.

d. Instead of using list concatenation now directly modify list1 by using 
   list1.extend(list2)

e. Pop off the very first element of list3 and save it to a variable named 
   first_element. Print out this variable. Also verify list3 has changed 
   (i.e. no longer has the first element).
