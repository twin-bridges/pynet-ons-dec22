Expand on exercise1 and create two new methods for your NetworkDevice class.

Method1 should be named “print_ip” and should print the IP address of the device.

Method2 should be named “print_creds” and should print the username and password
of the device.

Both methods should have only a single parameter “self”. No other parameters 
should be used.

Create an instance of this class and call your two methods.
