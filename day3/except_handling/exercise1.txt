Create a variable named filename.

Using a try/except block open the file referred to in the filename variable.

If the file does not exist gracefully handle the missing file using the following statement:

except FileNotFoundError:

If the file exists and is opened successfully, then print a message indicating this. If the 
file does not exist, then print a message that an error occurred in your exception block.

Test that your code works properly in both cases (i.e. both when the file exists and when it
doesn't exist).
