In a new Python file do the following.

Create a function that takes a number as input and returns the number squared.

Create a second function that takes two numbers and returns the product of those
numbers.

Use the "if __name__ == "__main__":" technique and separate the functions from the
executable code.

For the executable code, test your two functions using a couple of test cases. You can use 
assert statements to verify your test cases work.

For example, as a simple test you can do something like the following:

    result = squared(2)
    assert result == 4

Introduce a simple error in your testing (i.e. something that results in the test statements being False)
and observe that your testing catches this error).
