Functions Ex4
--------------

Based on your earlier exercise where you parsed the serial number from
 show_version (or use ex4_reference_base.py))
  
a. Create two functions
b. Function1 opens the file and returns all of the data in the file as a text 
   string. This function should take one argument (the filename).
c. Function2 parses the show_version output and returns the serial number
